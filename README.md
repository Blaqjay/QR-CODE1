### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project made me understand how to size the div container with repect to the image.

```css
.container{
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    border-radius: 1rem;
    background-color: var(--White);
    width: 320px;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    padding: 2rem;
    gap: 1rem;
}

img{
    display: block;
    border-radius: 1rem;
    /* margin-top: 1.5rem; */
}
```

### Continued development

I am not yet satified with the knowledge of CSS i have, I will like to practice more project to make me understand CSS more and Semantic elements in HTML
